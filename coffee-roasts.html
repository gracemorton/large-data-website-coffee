		        		<p>Roasting is a heat process that turns coffee into the fragrant, dark brown beans with which we are most familiar. Before being roasted, the beans were stored green, a state in which they can be kept without loss of quality or taste. Once roasted, however, they should be used as quickly as possible before the fresh roast flavor begins to diminish.</p>
						
						<p>Given a good-quality bean, roasting is probably the single most important factor influencing the flavor of coffee. The most significant variable is degree, or darkness, of roast. The longer the coffee is held in the roaster and/or the higher the roasting temperature, the darker the bean. The darker the bean, the more tangy and bittersweet the flavor.

			<h2>DIFFERENT ROASTS</h2>

<div class="unit unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3 unit-l-1-3">
	<div class="unit-spacer">
        	<h3>LIGHT ROAST</h3>
			<p>Light brown in color. This roast is generally preferred for milder coffee varieties. There will be no oil on the surface of these beans, because they are not roasted long enough for the oils to break through to the surface</p>
			<p> In a light roast, the difference between different origins is at its most distinct, and the unique qualities of each bean (Ethiopian vs. Guatemalan vs. Indonesian, etc.) are most obvious, and can be celebrated. At this point the bean also has the highest acidity and brightness.</p>

			<p>The true sense of terroir can best be determined by a lighter roast. One can taste the nuances of each growing region.</p>

			<h3>MEDIUM ROAST</h3>
            <p>Medium brown in color with a stronger flavor,  and a non-oily surface. This roast is often referred to as the American roast because it is generally preferred in the United States.</p>
			<p>Medium roast coffees are smoother, sweeter and less acidic than light roast coffees. In addition to city, full city and America, medium roast coffees include regular roast, breakfast roast and brown roast.</p>

<div class="unit unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3 unit-l-1-3">
		<div class="unit-spacer">
			<h3>DARK ROAST</h3>
			<p>Dark roast simply means that the coffee bean has been roasted to a higher temperature and typically for a longer period of time. This causes all of the flavor molecules stored within the coffee beans-both the good and bad flavors-to be burnt away. By roasting so dark, the end consumer (you) can't tell whether it's a good bean or a bad bean because all the natural flavors have been turned to charcoal.
</p>
			<p> The darker the roast, the less likely you'll experience the subtle apricot flavors in a great Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, or the blueberry notes in a wonderful Harrar, or the earthy, ripened notes of a great Sumatran Mandheling.</p>
