=========================

I really needed to redo this site, starting from scratch with new repo just seems easiest and more organized.

# Coffee
Coffee is probably one of the world's most important beverages to exist, aside from water. Coffee is the influsion of roasted, ground or crushed seeds of the coffee tree, of the genus Coffea. However, coffee plays a bigger role than just a tasty beverage; it is a lifestyle. 

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about the good, the bad and the ugly of the ever so popular caffinated beverage. 

Iâ€™m excited to learn about both the positive and negative effects that coffee has on us coffee lovers.
