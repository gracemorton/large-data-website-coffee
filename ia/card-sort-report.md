## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	- I don't recall any comments being made. They just went at it.
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	- They didn't actually ask any questions, they seemed to understand the topics in front of them.
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	- I noticed that neither of them put anything under the *Origin of Coffee* header. 
	- I also noticed that *Card Slot 2* created their own header to put *Countries that produce Coffee*, while *Card Slot 1* created that as a header with nothing in that group. I would have group those 2 topics together.
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	- Some of the headers were different. For example, *Caffine FAQ* was used as a header in Card Slot 1; however it was placed under header *Other* in Card slot 2.
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
 	- I was surpised that "Green Coffee Bean" was placed under the header *Strange Facts about Coffee.* I thought it would go under *Different Types of Coffee.*
 	- I was also surpised that there was no content under *Origin of Coffee* in Card Slot 1, because I would have placed *Countries that produce Coffee* in that header, instead of making both of those headers and not puting anything in them. 
 	- Lastly I was suprised with *Card Slot 1* putting *What your coffee preference says about you* under *Different types of Coffee* header when I would have placed that under *Strange Facts about Coffee.*
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	- Results from *Card Slot 2* were more similar to my expectations. I would make changes to the organization of *Card Slot 1.*
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	- Honestly king of relieved because I wasn't too sure myself where everything would be best organized and I liked seeing different perspectives from different people.
